**Informational**
```
Enter a bitcoin amount and click calculate

The exchanged amount for three currencies will be displayed below.

The report component display all the requested exchange rates keyed by time.  
It does not store the requested bitcoin amount at that date.  
Right now it is just a stringify json payload.  Idea is to generate a line graph with y=bitcoin, x=time

The app integrates with Bittrex and Poloniex
